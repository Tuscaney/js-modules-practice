# JS Modules Practice

This project demonstrates how to organize code using ES6 modules in Node.js by separating utility functions into reusable modules.

## ðŸ“„ Conceptual Reflection

### export / import vs module.exports / require

One key technical difference is that `export/import` is static and resolved at compile time, while `module.exports/require` is dynamic and resolved at runtime.

### Why choose ES modules for modern Node projects?

ES modules are the modern standard supported natively in both Node.js and browsers, allowing for cleaner syntax and better compatibility with frontend tools.
